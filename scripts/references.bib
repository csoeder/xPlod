abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

@article{Yoshii2011,
abstract = {The epidermis serves as a barrier protecting organs and tissues from the environment, and comprises many types of cells. A cell renewal system is established in epidermis: old epithelial cells are replaced by newly differentiated cells, which are derived from epidermal stem cells located near basement membrane. In order to examine the mechanism of epidermal development, we isolated a novel gene expressed in Xenopus epidermis and named the gene Xenopus polka dots (Xpod) from its polka dot-like expression pattern throughout larval periods. Several immunohistochemical examinations showed that the Xpod-expressing cell type is neither p63-positive epidermal stem ce$\alpha$he $\alpha$-tubulin-positive ciliated cells, but a subset of the foxi1e-positive ionocytes. The forced gene expression of foxi1e caused the suppression of Xpod expression, while Xpod showed no effect on foxi1e expression. In a comparison of several osmotic conditions, we found that hypertonic culture caused the increase in number of the Xpod-expressing cell, whereas number of the foxi1e-expressing cells was reduced under the hypertonic condition. These results show the possibility that Xpod is involved in the establishment of a certain subpopulation of ionocytes under hypertonic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Zoological Society of Japan.},
