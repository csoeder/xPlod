abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

@article{Yoshii2011,
abstract = {The epidermis serves as a barrier protecting organs and tissues from the environment, and comprises many types of cells. A cell renewal system is established in epidermis: old epithelial cells are replaced by newly differentiated cells, which are derived from epidermal stem cells located near basement membrane. In order to examine the mechanism of epidermal development, we isolated a novel gene expressed in Xenopus epidermis and named the gene Xenopus polka dots (Xpod) from its polka dot-like expression pattern throughout larval periods. Several immunohistochemical examinations showed that the Xpod-expressing cell type is neither p63-positive epidermal stem ce$\alpha$he $\alpha$-tubulin-positive ciliated cells, but a subset of the foxi1e-positive ionocytes. The forced gene expression of foxi1e caused the suppression of Xpod expression, while Xpod showed no effect on foxi1e expression. In a comparison of several osmotic conditions, we found that hypertonic culture caused the increase in number of the Xpod-expressing cell, whereas number of the foxi1e-expressing cells was reduced under the hypertonic condition. These results show the possibility that Xpod is involved in the establishment of a certain subpopulation of ionocytes under hypertonic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Zoological Society of Japan.},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {Motivation: Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming, and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high level programming languages (e.g., Python and Java) and provide limited multithreading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per read quality cutting, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. It also supports unique molecular identifier preprocessing, poly tail trimming, output splitting, and base correction for paired-end data. It can automatically detect adapters for single-end and paired-end FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multithreading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2 to 5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools. Availability and Implementation: The open-source code and corresponding instructions are available at https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp},

abstract = {Motivation: The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized genomics in early 2000s. The next revolution came with the era of long-read sequencing. These technological advances along with novel computational approaches became the next step towards the automatic pipelines capable to assemble nearly complete mammalian-size genomes. Results: In this manuscript, we demonstrate performance of the state-of-the-art genome assembly software on six eukaryotic datasets sequenced using different technologies. To evaluate the results, we developed QUAST-LG?a tool that compares large genomic de novo assemblies against reference sequences and computes relevant quality metrics. Since genomes generally cannot be reconstructed completely due to complex repeat patterns and low coverage regions, we introduce a concept of upper bound assembly for a given genome and set of reads, and compute theoretical limits on assembly correctness and completeness. Using QUAST-LG, we show how close the assemblies are to the theoretical optimum, and how far this optimum is from the finished reference.},
